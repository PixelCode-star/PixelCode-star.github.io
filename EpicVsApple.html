  <h1>
The Situation at Large</h1> </div>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Recently Epic Games has added to the long list of people who have recieved the ban hammer from Apple <br>policy on all income generated from in app purchases on the iPhone. Epic Games being widely <br>known among their so called fans for creations such as the Fortnight game, which as of August 30, <br>2020 is the world’s largest battle Royal game and game in general. Epic Games has an in-app <br>
<br>purchase through an in-game currency called V bucks. For a while the only way to attain V-bucks <br>was through the App-store but Epic decided that 30% of every purchase of V-bucks was way too <br>high a price and decided to bypass this by introducing a way for people to directly purchase <br>V-bucks. This is when the battle started with Apple. Apple not liking that a big chunk of its <br>revenue was cut off went into all out attack mod onto Epic games. Apple then went so far as to <br>delete Epic Games’ developer account from the App-store.

 <div id "herder"><h1>THE INEVITABLE BAN</h1><div>
 <p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Epic Games having directly violated Apples’ terms and conditions of service were or must have been <br>
 aware that the ban was inevitable. Apple is not the only app store to ban Epic Games from their store<br>
 ,Google play  too banned Epic Games just last year but that didn’t hurt the company so much as the<br>
 Apple ban. Why , you may be wondering. Doesn’t Android run on most devices than IOS devices. <br>
 You would be right to say this But There are so many app-stores on Android , people could always just<br>
 t download Fortnight on those other stores but for iPhone Phones , the App-store is the only <br>alternative to acquire apps other than from third party websites which themselves are not very<br> much encouraged because they could possibly damage your very much expensive iPhone. <br>The App-store is where Apple can Practise its monopolistic behavior without anyone saying a thing <br>, or so we all thought.Epic however had a different idea on the entire situation filing a 62 page<br> lawsuit to Apple for Anti-competitive and Monopolistic behavior. This itself should cast an eye of<br> suspicion onto Epic, that they knew ,they’d get banned. A good old tale of the Cat provoking the dog.<br>

 <h2>
Why Strike Now
</h2><div>
 <p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Why does Epic Strike Now. Why would Epic ,a small gaming company compared to the big tech giant that is <br>Apple pick such a fight. Well its quite simple. Epic chose this to be the best moment to strike <br>Apple as this is the time that Apple seems to be most vulnerable. Yes if there was a better time to <br>strike a big tech company, it would be now where these companies are worried about Anti-trust <br>issues that came up last year. Starting with whole situation between Spotify and Apple music, <br>Spotify accusing Apple of monopolistic behavior of undercutting prices. Apple is taking hits from <br>everybody, Microsoft with the X cloud issue competing with the Iphone’s Arcade. Apple seems to <br>be most vulnerable. These Companies on their own have no single shred of a chance of stopping <br>apple or infultriating the IOS ecosystem. Apple being a company that is focused on the end all <br>User experience and control , Epic poses at this time a serious threat. Apple also being <br>investigated by the EU for anti-competitive behaviour , Apple could not be more vulnerable. If <br>Epic wins the lawsuit , Developers would be entitled to the same deal but this doesn't seem <br>
<br>appealing to Apple ,giving up almost all their revenue in App Purchase. If Epic however loses , <br>This would go extremely bad for epic . The aftermath of this if Epic doesn't win is as I can only say <br>“Epic Disaster.”. Making enemies with one world’s largest big tech companies is a stupid decision <br>that shouldn't even be in any CEO’s realm of thought.

<div id = "herder"><h1>THE UNREAL ENGINE</h1><div>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>The Unreal engine being widely used by game developers is an Asset of Epic Games. Closing the <br>unreal engine would be direct and a death blow to epic games but luckily for epic games the <br>judge ruled that Apple cannot close the Unreal engine as it would impact other developers who <br>did nothing to Apple. A close call for Epic.  Small game developers live to see another day but if I <br>was a game developer I would think of another alternative because given Apple’s history , this <br>could go in all directions for Epic. 
</p>
<div is = "herder"><h1>Epic Games’ Master Plan</h1><div>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Simply Epic must have seen this coming.You don’t bite the dog’s bone and expect it to lie down. It will <br>come for you with everything its got. Such as I used the example of a dog’s bone. You should never <br>touch the dog’s bone without having the muscle to back it up.  Of-course its not that Epic is starting <br>a fight for the sake of starting a fight. If it was a company like Google or Facebook ,it would be  <br>understandable and at least probable but for Epic ,it doesn't make much sense.Fortnight was on IOS <br>first. Apple made Fortnight to what it is today. A dog biting the hand that fed it. Apple is not taking <br>this lightly. The real reason is that Epic is pushing for their own App-store called Epic Apps and this is <br>already in existence but with only Fortnight. Apple knows this and we will have to wait to see <br>how this all unfolds
